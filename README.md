## Bouncing Word Screensaver


</div>

### Description

This is a screensaver, and my first code submitted to Planet Source Code. It is fully compatible as a Windows screensaver, with code to support screensaver preview and settings. The two settings available are what text to display to be bounced around the screen and the speed of which to bounce it. The core bouncing code was done by someone else on PSC, but I modified it and made it more customizable. The code has a lot of error checking, with features like making sure the speed is not set to zero. The settings are outputted to an ini file in the c:\windows directory. I hope you enjoy this screensaver as much as I enjoyed writing it.
 
### More Info
 
Creates an ini file in the c:\windows directory, but that does not affect anything.
